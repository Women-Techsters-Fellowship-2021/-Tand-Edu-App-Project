# Background

COVID-19 has dramatically reshaped the way global education is delivered. Millions of learners were affected by educational institution closures due to the pandemic, which resulted in the largest online movement in the history of education.

Africa is one of the continents that is behind in technological advancements, and as such, things like online education were never a priority as there is so much ground to cover in implementing this way of learning and the costs are considered as “expensive”.   

The pandemic regulations shut down the countries in March 2020, and as such schools were closed for a great number of weeks. Alternative means of learning is still a struggle for the previously mentioned reasons. 

It is was also established in 2019, that the difference between internet accessibility to men and women in developed countries was only 3%, while in least developed countries had a significant difference of 11.1%. This could mean that African women are affected even more by covid-19

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

In what ways did Covid-19 affect education in African Nations?  
How effective was the transition to online learning in different African countries?
Does online Education work in all
African countries?
How can we facilitate equal education standards across low income and high income countries?

#Project Objective

Our goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis on the effect of covid-19 on the  education system of different African Countries. 

Bridge the education gap in developed and underdeveloped countries by building a model App that fosters connections between students and teachers across low income and high income countries on various subjects areas. 

# Tandem APP
The tandem app is an application that would provide a platform for students and teachers in developing and developed countries to interact for the purpose of learning, and knowledge sharing on academic and socio-cultural aspects, with an aim to breach the gab in the educational sector as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. It offers students the opportunity to find a match in other countries based on certain attributes they posses and topics/areas they may be interested in. The app also provide oppourtunity for entertainment
